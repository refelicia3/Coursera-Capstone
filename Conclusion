The F1 Score and Jaccard similarity index calculations suggest that this data set may not be a good model to accurately predict Road Traffic Accidents 
for this county.  Unless there is another data set available with the recommended values covered on the Discussion section.
The root causes for accidents on Dry, Clear and in broad daylight may be a direct result of the following:
More cars are on the road during these conditions. 
There are less cars when the road is Frosty or Icy.
The vehicles may have experienced a problem.  The vehicle's age was not available for interpretation.  Perhaps, the driver had a braking problem.
Collisions may have been a result of reckless driving.  This is common when the Speed Limit is 60 KM or above.
The driver may have been distracted or texting. This information was not available on the data set.
The driver's age was not disclosed on this data set. 
If the driver is 18 or below, this may suggest that the driver does not have extensive driving experience to avoid an accident.
The driver's health condition was also not available. The driver may have suffered a medical condition that led to the accident.
The driver may have slept on the wheel, and as a result, may have caused the accident.
If these recommended data responses are made available, another regression can be performed. 
The accuracy score should be much higher than the ones calculated during this time.
