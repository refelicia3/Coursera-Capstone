Having said that, I will be using the Road Traffic Conditions data set (RTC Location 2018.csv). 
This data file is available from the Cambridgeshire County Council web site.
I will be testing the data from 2018. This data set contains all of the factors that I've previously mentioned, and maybe included on my model.
This Comma Separated Value (CSV) file will require data cleansing (preparation) in order to convert strings (defined as a Python object) into an Integer.
Once these columns are converted to Integer, the columns can be fitted into a train-test-split regression model.
