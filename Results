The calculation results from the Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) did not yield high accuracy scores.
From LR, the F1 Score was 0.6076 and the Jaccard was 0.7236.
SVM yielded an F1 Score of 0.6284 and a Jaccard of 0.7358.
This suggests that the models needed more precise data in order to derive a higher accuracy score.
