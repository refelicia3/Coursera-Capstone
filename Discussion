Observations:
More accidents occured on a Dry Road Condition (defined as a 20 on the Road Dictionary. The highest value is 80 for Frosty or Icy Road.
In general, there were more casualties when the Speed Limit was either 60 KM (kilometers) or 70 KM.
There were more casualties when the Weather was "Fine with No High Wind".  This was defined as a 10 on the Weather Dictionary.
There were more accidents in Daylight (defined as a 10 on the Visibility Dictionary).
The highest casualty per incident (20, 11) happened on a Dry road, in broad Daylight, and on a clear (Fine with no high wind) day.
Road number 0 (zero) had the most number of casualties at 223. This was followed by Road Number 47.  The casualties were considered Fatal or Serious.
There appears to be more road volume during Daylight and when the conditions are Clear (Weather) and Dry (Road).
Severity 3 (defined as Slight Casualties) has the highest volume of personal accidents.
Recommendations:
I recommend that the Cambridgeshire County needs to capture more information on their Collision data set.
What was the extent of the personal injury?
What was the damage to the vehicles?
Was the driver or drivers under the influence of alcohol?  Was the driver under the influence of drugs?
How fast was the vehicle driving above the speed limit?
