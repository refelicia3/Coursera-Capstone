My approach was to code in Python and running the object using Jupyter Notebook on an IBM Watson platform.
There were four columns that required Data Cleansing from a Python object into an Integer.
These columns are Severity, Road Conditions (Road_Con), Visibility and Weather.
In addition, I assigned arbitrary numeric values to each column.
For Severity, a value of a 1 was assigned to Fatal. A value of a 2 for Serious and a 3 for Slight.
A similar rating scale was created for the Road_Con and Weather.
To derive the prediction, I calculated the F1 Score and Jaccard Index.
I decide to run the analysis using two models, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Matrix (SVM).
