Introduction and Business Case:
I work for an auto insurance organization. I was given the assignment for calculating the probability of Fatal Auto accidents
in the region of Cambridgeshire, UK. There are multiple dependent and indepent factors to consider.
Amongst them are Road Conditions, Visibility, Time of the Day, Day of the Week, Number of Vehicles Involved,
the Road Type, Speed Limit (in Kilometers), the Weather and Road Number (Identification).

It is my responsibility to create the best possible model to perform Predictive Analysis for this test case.
Having said that, I will be using the Road Traffic Conditions data set (RTC Location 2018.csv). This data file 
is available from the Cambridgeshire County Council web site. I will be testing the data from 2018.
This data set contains all of the factors that I've previously mentioned, and maybe included on my model.
